Why are M&Ms always happy,Because there's no blue
Why did the fire get under the tree,Becasue the tree got on fire
Why did the witch throw a potion at Steve,To make him turn into a wither
Why did the wither make everything on fire,To destroy the planet
Why did the chicken cross the road,To get to the other side
Why did the ender dragon make the world into an ender dragon,To make five thousand two hundred eighty eight monsters
